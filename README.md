# Kannada-MNIST-Classification

## Description
The "Kannada MNIST Classification" project addresses a fascinating machine-learning challenge that involves recognizing handwritten digits in the Kannada script. Unlike traditional Hindu numerals, the Kannada script represents the numerals used predominantly by the people of Karnataka in southwestern India, where the Kannada language is spoken by approximately 45 million native speakers.

Problem Statement:

The primary goal of this project is to create a robust classification system for Kannada digits. The dataset used for this task is known as the "Kannada MNIST" dataset, which is a recently-released dataset designed specifically for the Kannada language. This dataset consists of handwritten Kannada digits, and it presents a 10-class classification problem, where each class corresponds to a different digit.

Key Components:

Kannada Script: Kannada is a rich and intricate script used for writing the Kannada language. It holds cultural significance in the region and is distinct from the familiar Hindu-Arabic script used for English numerals.

Dataset: The dataset required for this project can be obtained from Kaggle at the following link: Kannada MNIST Dataset. It includes a substantial number of handwritten Kannada digits for both training and testing purposes.

Dataset Curation: The dataset's curation and details have been meticulously documented in the research paper titled "Kannada-MNIST: A new handwritten digits dataset for the Kannada language" by Vinay Uday Prabhu. You can find this paper here: Research Paper.

Project Goals:

The primary objectives of this project:

Utilize machine learning techniques to accurately classify handwritten Kannada digits into their respective categories.
Apply dimensionality reduction through PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to simplify the feature space.
Experiment with various classification models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-NN Classifier, and SVM.
Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC curves.
